  "Tutorial_1": "Creating and using classes in Python for object-oriented programming. Benefits of using classes to logically group data and functions for reuse and easy building upon. Creating a \"Employee\" class as a blueprint for representing individual employees in a company. Understanding the difference between a class and an instance of a class. Exploring instance variables that store unique data for each instance of a class. Manually setting instance variables for each employee and introducing the __init__ method (constructor) to automate the process. Eliminating manual assignment of variables by utilizing the __init__ method. Creating methods within a class, such as a \"full name\" method for combining first and last names of an employee. The significance of including the self argument in methods to reference the instance.
