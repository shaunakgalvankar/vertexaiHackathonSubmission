  "Tutorial_1": "Creating and using classes in Python for object-oriented programming. Benefits of using classes to logically group data and functions for reuse and easy building upon. Creating a \"Employee\" class as a blueprint for representing individual employees in a company. Understanding the difference between a class and an instance of a class. Exploring instance variables that store unique data for each instance of a class. Manually setting instance variables for each employee and introducing the __init__ method (constructor) to automate the process. Eliminating manual assignment of variables by utilizing the __init__ method. Creating methods within a class, such as a \"full name\" method for combining first and last names of an employee. The significance of including the self argument in methods to reference the instance. Distinguishing between calling methods with an instance and calling them with the class itself, with a mention of upcoming topics on class variables and an invitation for questions and support.",
  "Tutorial_2":"Learned how to create a simple class and instances of that class.Instance variables are used for data unique to each instance.Instance variables are set using the self argument. Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. Class variables hold data that should be the same for each instance. Annual raise amount is a good candidate for a class variable. Class variables can be accessed through the class or instances. Instances access class variables through the class's attribute. Instances can have their own attributes, which override the class variables. Introduced the concept of class methods and static methods (to be covered in the next video).",
  "Tutorial_3":"Difference between instance variables and class variables. Introduction to regular methods, class methods, and static methods. Regular methods take the instance as the first argument (self). Class methods take the class as the first argument (cls) using the @classmethod decorator. Class methods can modify class variables and are accessed through the class or instances. Static methods don't automatically take the instance or class as arguments. Static methods behave like regular functions and are included in classes for logical connection. Example of a static method to check if a given date is a workday. Identifying when to use static methods by checking if instance or class variables are not used. Mentioned upcoming topic: inheritance and creating subclasses.",
  "Tutorial_4":"Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. Subclasses can customize and add new functionality without affecting the parent class. Example of creating subclasses (developers and managers) based on an employee class. By inheriting from the employee class, subclasses inherit its attributes and methods. Method resolution order determines where Python searches for attributes and methods. Using the help() function to visualize the method resolution order and inherited methods. Subclasses can customize methods by overriding them with their own implementation. Changes in subclass methods do not affect instances or methods in the parent class. Subclassing improves code reusability and maintainability in larger projects. Real-world example of subclassing in the Python requests library's exceptions module.", 
  "Tutorial_5":"Special methods, also known as magic methods, allow us to emulate built-in behavior and implement operator overloading. Examples of built-in behavior: addition of integers and concatenation of strings. Special methods are denoted by double underscores (dunder) before and after the method name. Common special methods include init, repr, and str. init is used to initialize class attributes when objects are created. repr provides an unambiguous representation of an object for debugging. str provides a readable representation of an object for end-users. Special methods allow us to change how objects are printed and displayed. Special methods for arithmetic, such as add, allow customization of operators. Real-world examples in the standard library demonstrate the practical use of special methods.",
  "Tutorial_6":"The property decorator allows us to add getter, setter, and deleter functionality to class attributes. Using the property decorator, we can define methods that can be accessed like attributes. An example problem: the email attribute depends on the first name and last name attributes. Changing the first name doesn't automatically update the email attribute. Creating a separate email method would require code changes in existing implementations. The property decorator provides a solution by allowing us to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. Applying the property decorator to the email method enables accessing it like an attribute. Setter functionality: using a setter decorator with the same name as the property allows setting attribute values. The setter method can parse the provided value and update relevant attributes accordingly. The property decorator can also be used to define a deleter method that runs code when an attribute is deleted."
